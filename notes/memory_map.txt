TIA Addressing Notes for the Atari VCS
--------------------------------------
A12 is connected to /CS0 (Chip Select 0 - active low)
A7 is connected to /CS3  (Chip Select 3 - active low)
A[11:8] and A6 are not connected to the TIA

VCC is connected to CS1  (Chip Select 1 - active high)
GND is connected to /CS2 (Chip Select 2 - active low)
